# Process Settings

This is the golang implementation of the `process_settings` library originally written in [Ruby](https://github.com/Invoca/process_settings).
The overall functionality of the library is the same, but due to the nature of Golang, the implementation is slightly different.
Please read through the documentation below to understand how to use this library in your project.
